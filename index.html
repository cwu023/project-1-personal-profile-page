        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm working towards my way of being a web developer. Growing up I never truly knew what I wanted to pursuit as a career. I got a stable job after college but was never satisfied with it. I feel I could do much more. And then one day I accidentally clicked on a YouTube video that talks about web development and after that video I became very curious about this industry and began to learn more about it.</p>

        <p>I started learning to code as a habbit, but the more I learned the more I feel that maybe I should pursuit web development as my career. So after a while of dabbling around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I finally decided I want to fully commit myself into coding and build a career out of it. Therefore, I enrolled into Teamtreehouse's Front-End Web Development Techdegree Program and decided to finish it whithin 6 months on top of my full-time job. It is not easy to do but I believe that taking 1 to 2 hours each day after work and 4 to 5 hours during the weekends to learn code will eventually help me get a career in web development.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to become a web developer that is proficient in the following skills:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Node</li>

        <p>I would like to work with a web development team that would help me grow as a better developer and a better team member.</p>

        <h2>Habbits</h2>
        <p>Outside of coding I'm also a big basketball fan. I love watching NBA and playing basketball during the weekends. I belive being physically active and healthy can help me maintain a sharper mind while coding.</p>
        <p>Besides that I'm also kind of a sneakerhead for basketball shoes, here are some of my favorite basketball shoes:</p>
